# FusionSolarPy

A very basic python client for the HuaweiFusionSolar API used to monitor
solar power plants.

This client uses the https://region01eu5.fusionsolar.huawei.com end point by default. It is
possible to change this using the `huawei_subdomain` parameter. But this has not
been tested on any other end-points.

Please report any bugs!

## Installation

Simply install from pypi using:

```bash
pip install fusion_solar_py
```

## Usage

See exploration.ipynb notebook for usage
